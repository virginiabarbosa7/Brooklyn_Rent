<h5> One of the main reasons for this increase has been that since the financial crises of 2008-09 the city's population has grown from half-a-million residents to 8.6 million, while the number of new housing units grew by only 100,000 - a fraction of what was actually needed. By consequence, rents has risen by over 24% on average over the same period.</h5>
